# Activity Log

Append-only. Newest entries at the bottom. Every agent writes a START entry
before its first product edit and a FINISH entry after its last, naming the
commit, the actual test counts, and the mutation-check result.

Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM IST — <agent>/<provider> — START TASK-NNN
- one line on what is being built
```

```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM IST — <agent>/<provider> — FINISH TASK-NNN
- implementation commit <hash>; one line on what landed
- `bun test`: N pass, N fail, N assertions across N files; typecheck, prompt
  check and diff check results
- mutation check: which test failed and with what message
```

The repository carries the memory, not the chat.

## 2026-09-06 00:00 IST — root/local — FINISH TASK-001

- `bun test`: 8 pass, 0 fail, 11 assertions across 1 file; `bun build src/config.ts --target=bun`: passed; `git diff --check`: passed.
